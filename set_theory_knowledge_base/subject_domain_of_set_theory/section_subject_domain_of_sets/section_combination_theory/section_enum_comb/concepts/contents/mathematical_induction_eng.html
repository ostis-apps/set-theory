<p>Mathematical induction is a method of mathematical proof that is used to prove the truth of a certain statement for all <sc_element sys_idtf="natural_number">natural numbers</sc_element>. To do this, the truth of the statement with number 1 is first checked - the induction base (basis). Then, it is proven that if the statement with number n is true, then the next statement with number n + 1 is also true - the induction step, or the inductive step.</p>
