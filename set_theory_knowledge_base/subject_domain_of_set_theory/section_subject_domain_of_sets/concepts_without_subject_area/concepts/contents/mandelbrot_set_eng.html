<p>Mandelbrot set is a set of points <b>c</b> on the complex plane for which the recurrence relation <i>z<sub>n+1</sub>=z<sub>n</sub><sup >2</sup>+c</i> specifies a limited sequence. In other words, this is the set of <b>c</b> for which there exists a real <b>R</b> such that the inequality <i>|z<sub>n</sub>| < R</i> is satisfied for all natural <b>n</b>.
